## What is this?

This is a trainer written to help people practice v1.8.6a of Ghosts N' Demons, an awesome (and incredibly difficult) remake created by BonusJZ.

A video tutorial of the game was created by the Gameplay and Talk folks in:

if you're looking to learn the mechanics.

## What can this do?

Currently:

- Weapon selection
- Level selection
- Make all chests drop armor
- Lives increase/decrease

## How do I use it?

1. Download the latest version of `GnDTrainer.zip` from the [Releases](https://github.com/OmegaVVeapon/GnDTrainer/releases) page.
2. Run the `GnDTrainer.exe`
3. Start Ghosts N' Demon v1.8.6a (steps 2 and 3 are interchangeable)
4. Enjoy

## Gotchas

### Level selection

After clicking `Set Level!`, you'll need to die to trigger the level load logic.

To make this a bit faster, I set Arthur's armor to 0 so the next hit will kill.
